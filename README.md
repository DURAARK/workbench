# The DURAARK Workbench

The DURAARK Workbench is an integrated software prototype showcasing the functionality developed in
the European Commision funded project [DURAARK](http://duraark.eu).

Multiple research and industry partners are contributing to the software. To ease the integration work
of the different contributions a coding framework is provided ([the DURAARK Framework](https://github.com/DURAARK/workbench/tree/master/server/core)) to give developers a
guideline on how to integrate their custom functionality into the integrated Workbench application.

A Software Development Guide can be found [here](https://github.com/DURAARK/workbench/wiki).
